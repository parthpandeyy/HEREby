# "HEREby - 20 Min City"

**Problem Statement-**  Providing the users with POIs within 20 mins of travel distance depending on the category requested by user. eg - list of restaurants 20 mins from user.


**Proposed solution-** -> Make an application to help navigate the user to his desired place of interest.

-> To provide safe, reliable and interesting places within 20 mins of travel.

-> To keep in mind the mode of transport (on foot/bicycle/car) and the exact need of the user.

-> Check if the user is just wanting to explore / in need of something or stuck up in an emergency situation and have a UI that proceeds accordingly.

-> Provide multiple options like -- Explore - Fine dine/cafes/museum/parks/bowling 
                                    Need - Pharmacies/garage/fuel station/ATM etc.
                                    Emergency - Police/Hospitals/Roadside Assistance

-> To provide the user with maximum available options in a set radius, as requested by them.

-> Any urgents needs of the user would be taken care of. Eg- If they need a garage, medical store, fuel stations, public restrooms, ATMâ€™s etc.

-> Take care of any emergency situations the user may be trapped in and navigate them to nearest hospitals / police stations and call 24x7 roadside assistance.


**Technology Stack-** We plan to use Flutter and multiple API's from HERE. The coding will be done in Microsoft Virtual Studio Code and written in Dart.
